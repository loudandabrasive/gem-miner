##Launching the gem-miner

- Download [the npm](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm), if you don't already have it and call `npm-install` in the root directory to get any misisng packages.
- Install [the gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), if you haven't already by `npm install -g gulp` so you can run the gulp from your command line.
- Run `gulp` to compile the scripts together and the handlebars files into Ember templates.
- Open `index.html` and _rock_ out!
